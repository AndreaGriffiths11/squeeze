# Contributing to Squeeze

Thanks for your interest in contributing! Squeeze is a simple, browser-based video compressor and contributions are welcome.

## Getting started

1. Fork the repo
2. Clone your fork
3. Start a local server:
   ```bash
   npx serve .
   ```
4. Open `http://localhost:3000` and make your changes to `index.html`

## Guidelines

- Squeeze is a single `index.html` file. Keep it that way — no build steps, no frameworks.
- Test your changes in Chrome and Firefox before submitting.
- Keep PRs focused. One feature or fix per PR.
- Make sure video compression still works end-to-end after your changes.

## Reporting bugs

Open an issue with:
- What you expected to happen
- What actually happened
- Browser and OS
- File size and format of the video (if relevant)

## Ideas and feature requests

Open an issue and describe what you'd like to see. Keep in mind the goal is simplicity — Squeeze should stay easy to understand and use.
